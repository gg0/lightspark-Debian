Lightspark third Technical demo README

First of all I'd like to thank you for testing the lightspark project,
the current status is kind of stable, although not ready for end users

Be aware that the following feature are not yet supported or stable enough to be include in the demo

-) Sound support
-) Input support
-) Antialiasing

This demo already includes a lot of cool features

-) GLSL based rendering of fill styles (eg. gradients)
-) LLVM based ActionScript execution. Code is compiled just in time
-) A few tricks are also played to decrease the stack traffic tipical of stack machines.
-) First, although simple, framerate timing
-) Framework to handle ActionScript asynchronous events.

NOTE:
Currently only 64bit and 32bit platforms with SSE2 extension are supported. Support for previous processor will
be ready soon.

INSTALLATION:
To compile this software you need to install development packages for llvm-2.7, sdl, opengl, curl, zlib, libavcodec, ftgl, libglew, fontconfig.
If sound is enabled (on by default), you need the development package for pulseaudio-libs.
If the browser plugin is enabled (off by default), you need the development package for xulrunner.
Install also cmake and nasm
To build the software please follow those steps.

1) cd lightspark
2) mkdir objs
3) cd objs
4) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCOMPILE_PLUGIN=1 ..
5) make
6) sudo make install

DEBUG MODE:
To enable debug mode change the cmake command like this:
4b) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCOMPILE_PLUGIN=1

Sound support may be disabled passing to cmake the following option: -DENABLE_SOUND=0

EXECUTION:
This demo aims at rendering, the runtime generated UI of the new YouTube player. Recently YouTube switched 
to Flash 10 and AS3 to serve some HD content, while maintaining the old AS2 based player for lower quality content.

-) First of all download the YouTube player SWF file.
	wget http://s.ytimg.com/yt/swf/watch_as3-vfl172193.swf
-) The player works by gathering the parameters from the Javascript in the page. Lightspark support loading parameters from a text file
   using the --parameters-file command line. Create a suitable parameters file using the following commands
	cd scripts
	./youtube-args-dumper.sh http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N2YWRJ-ppo > ../yt-args
	cd ..
-) Execute the file, this will render the usual UI of the YouTube player and decoded video, no sound is played yet
	lightspark --parameters-file yt-args watch_as3-vfl172193.swf
