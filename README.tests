You can get the Flex 4 SDK at:
http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4

Flex 4 SDK is assumed to be installed in $FLEX_ROOT

To compile tests inside the tests/ directory use the following command:
$FLEX_ROOT/bin/mxmlc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries -compiler.omit-trace-statements=false test.mxml -output test.swf


NOTE: Use the ./tests script in tests/ to run the tests in an automated way.
      Run "./tests --help" inside tests/ to see its usage.

NOTE: Use template.mxml as a template for new testcases.

NOTE: We've provided a simple Tests class which should be used where possible to test general behaviour of AS classes. See Tests.as for its usage.

NOTE: Please use a naming scheme as follow:
      For toplevel classes: tests/CLASSNAME_test.mxml (CLASSNAME is the exact name of the class/function)
			For other classes: tests/NAMESPACE_CLASSNAME_test.mxml (NAMESPACE is for example "net" for "flash.net" classes/functions, e.g.: tests/net_NetStream_test.mxml)
			Please group all tests for one class in one file.

NOTE:	Tests that aren't suitable for testing with the Tests class should be put in tests/other. (e.g.: testing video playing, StageScaleMode testing etc...)
      The naming schemes still apply to these testcases though.

NOTE:	Tests for unimplemented features should be placed in tests/unimplemented.
