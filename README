Lightspark is an open source Flash player implementation for playing
files in SWF format. Lightspark can run as a web browser plugin or as
a standalone application.

Lightspark supports SWF files written on the newest version of the
ActionScript language, ActionScript 3.0, which was introduced at the
same time as Flash player 9.

INSTALLATION
============

To compile this software you need to install development packages for
llvm (version 2.8, 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2), opengl, curl, zlib, libavcodec,
libglew, pcre, librtmp, cairo, libboost-filesystem, libxml++ (version
2.33.1 or newer), gtk-2, libjpeg, libavformat, pango, liblzma

If sound is enabled (on by default), you will also need the
development package for pulseaudio-libs and/or libsdl.

If the browser plugin is enabled (on by default), you will need the
development package for xulrunner.

Install also gcc (version 4.6.0 or newer), cmake and nasm.

To build the software please follow these steps.

1) cd lightspark
2) mkdir obj
3) cd obj
4) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
5) make
6) sudo make install

DEBUG MODE:
To enable debug mode change the cmake command like this:
4b) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE available: Debug Release RelWithDebInfo Profile Sound
support may be disabled using the following option: -DENABLE_SOUND=0
The audio backend can be set using -DAUDIO_BACKEND=<pulseaudio|sdl>
(default is pulseaudio)

EXECUTION
=========

Using `make install`, lightspark is installed in the system wide
Firefox plugin path and Firefox should show it in the about:plugins
list and in the Tools->Add-ons->Plugins window.

Lightspark registers itself as the plugin for
application/x-shockwave-flash and for application/x-lightspark, so it
should be recognisable in the about:plugins page. Its description
string is "Shockwave Flash 12.1 r<current version>". The current
version is now "r710".

Firefox is not able to deal very well with multiple plugins for the
same MIME type. If you only see a black box where a flash app should
be try to remove any other flash plugin you have installed.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Ctrl+Q Quit (standalone player only)
Ctrl+M Mute/unmute sounds
Ctrl+P Show profiling data
Ctrl+C Copy an error to the clipboard (when Lightspark fails)
