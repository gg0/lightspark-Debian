Package: lightspark
Architecture: any-i386 any-amd64 powerpc armel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: gnash
Description: High-performance SWF player (experimental)
 Lightspark is a free Flash player for Linux which aims for high-performance
 by using modern technologies such as JIT compilation and OpenGL shaders.
 .
 The project is currently in an alpha status and provides the standalone
 player and browser plugin for testing purposes only.
 .
 Nice features:
  * JIT compilation of ActionScript to native x86 bytecode
  * Hardware accelerated rendering using OpenGL shaders (GLSL)
  * Aims to support current-generation ActionScript 3
  * A new, clean, codebase exploiting multithreading and optimized for modern
    hardware. Designed from scratch after the official Flash documentation was
    released.
