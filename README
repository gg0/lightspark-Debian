CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE available: Debug Release RelWithDebInfo Profile Debian

EXECUTION:
Using make install lightspark is installed in the system wide firefox plugin path and firefox should show it in about:plugins and in the 
Tools->Add-Ons->Plugins window.

Lightspark register itself as the plugin for application/x-shockwave-flash and for application/x-lightspark, so should be recognisable in the
about:plugins page. It's description string is "Shockwave Flash 10.0 r<current version>", now r42.

Firefox is not able to deal very well with multiple plugins for the same MIME type, if you only see a black box where a flash app should be try
to move away of the plugin directory any other flash plugin you have installed.
